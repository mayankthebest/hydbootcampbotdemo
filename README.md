# Image Recognition Bot
This is a Image Recognition Bot developed for Hyderabad Azure Bootcamp 2018. This bot is built on a serverless architecture (Azure Functions) and uses Azure Cognitive Services. Users interact with this bot by sending photos to it and it will reply back with what it sees in the photo. Additionally if the bot detects people in the photo, it will guess the ages and gender of them.
